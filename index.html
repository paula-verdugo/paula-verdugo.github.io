I'm currently a PhD student at Macquarie University, in Sydney, and my supervisor is <a href="https://dom-verity.github.io/">Dominic Verity</a>. My secondary advisor is <a href="https://emilyriehl.github.io/">Emily Riehl</a>, whom I visited at Johns Hopkins University for a year during my PhD. <br>

Previously, I was at Universität Osnabrück as part of the Graduiertenkolleg ‘Combinatorial Structures in Geometry‘ mentored by <a href="https://www.mathematik.uni-osnabrueck.de/forschung/ag_topologie_und_geometrie/spitzweck_markus.html">Markus Sptizweck</a>. Before that I did my Masters at Université Sorbonne Paris Nord, where Lawrence Breen was my thesis advisor. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay, where Walter Ferrer was my advisor. <br> 

My research interests are (higher) category theory, homotopy theory, algebraic K-theory, and their interactions. <br>
